This repository contains a collection of scripts developed in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) subjects. The scripts have been implemented using the Python programming language and cover a wide variety of fundamental concepts and techniques in both areas.

## Repository Contents

The repository covers the following topics and concepts:

### Graphs and Graph Search Algorithms

- Implementation of graphs using the NetworkX library in Python.
- Graph search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and Prim's algorithm.

### Perceptron

- Implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, a basic supervised learning model used in the field of AI.

### Computer Vision Filters

- Implementation of various computer vision filters, such as derivative filters, Canny, Prewitt, Sobel, Laplacian, GaussianBlur, and Laplacian with Gaussian filter.

### Computer Vision Object Descriptors

- Implementation of object descriptors in computer vision, including chromaticity, chromatic coordinates, and white patch.

### Template Matching

- Use of template matching to find specific patterns in an image.

### Image Filters

- Implementation of various image filters, such as average blur, Gaussian blur, median blur, maximum filter, and minimum filter.

## Final Notes

We hope that these scripts are helpful to you and provide valuable insights into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
